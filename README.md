# GeoGridTrainer

The goal is to get better at [https://www.geogridgame.com/](https://www.geogridgame.com/) ; There are several levels to this that all seem interesting and will help me get better.

## Level 1

Create a simple UI that looks like a big excel sheet with all categories as column (slightly more complex than that for others) with advanced filtering and sorting capabilities. Most of the time will be spend on data collecting and cleaning probably.

## Level 2

Add another UI to learn from prompt. The screen would say things like, which countries have more than 50 medals at the olympic games ? UI has 2 modes, one for single prompts and one for double prompts. Upon entering my results it would tell me which one are good, which one are wrong, and which one are missing.

## Level 3

Here we would use meta elements for example by looking at historical grids and what people answered. The goal is to know **in advance** which ones are most likely to be legendary. Maybe even creating a 'people interest' index that just looks at the number of connection of a country on wikipedia or something like this.
